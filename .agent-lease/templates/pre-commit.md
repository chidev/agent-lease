# Pre-Commit Validation Gate

## Standards Check
- [ ] Did you update docs if you changed public APIs?
- [ ] Did you add tests for new functionality?
- [ ] No console.log in production code?
- [ ] Following conventional commits?

## Changed Files

## Runners

When everything checks out:
  npx agent-lease lease pre-commit --audit-proof='<describe what you validated>'
